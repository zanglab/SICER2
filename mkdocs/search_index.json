Histone modifications usually occupy broad chromatin domains and result in diffuse patterns in ChIP-seq data that make it difficult to identify signal enrichment. SICER, a spatial clustering approach for the identification of ChIP-enriched regions, was developed for calling broad peaks from ChIP-seq data. \n\n\nUsability of the original SICER software has been affected by increased throughputs of ChIP-seq experiments over the years. We now present SICER2 a more user-friendly version of SICER that has been redisgned and streamlined to handle large ChIP-seq data sets. This new Python package supports multiple job submissions on cluster systems and parallel processing on multicore architectures.\n\n\nFor more information about the original SICER algorithm, please see\n\n\n\u201c\nA clustering approach for identification of enriched domains from histone modification\n ChIP-Seq data\n\" Chongzhi Zang, Dustin E. Schones, Chen Zeng, Kairong Cui, Keji Zhao, and\n Weiqun Peng, \nBioinformatics\n 25, 1952 - 1958 (2009)\n\n\nIn addition, we present an alternative algorithm for identification of broad domains from ChIP-seq data called RECOGNICER.\n\n\n(More detail about RECOGNICER TBD)\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nQuick Installation\n\n\nEasiest way to install SICER2 is through \npip\n. Simply open the terminal and type \npip install SICER2\n.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nPython Version\n\n\nUnlike the original version of SICER, SICER2 runs in Python 3.\nPlease use Python 3 to install and run SICER 2.0.\n\n\nLibraries\n\n\nNumpy and Scipy are required to run SICER2. Please have these installed before installing SICER2.\nThis can be done by simply typing \npip install numpy scipy\n under command line (if python2.7 is your default python version, use \npip3\n).\n\n\nC Compiler\n\n\nC compiler is required to compile C codes that are part of the SICER2 package. This also means that python header files (e.g. Python.h) are needed. For Linux users, make sure to have python-dev installed. For Mac OS X users, it is recommended that you install Xcode.\n\n\nBedTools\n\n\nLastly, if you would like to directly pass BAM files as input files for SICER2, you need to have \nbedtools\n installed. Please refer to this \nlink\n for more details on installing bedtools. This is not required if you will intend to only pass BED files as input files.\n\n\nOther Installations\n\n\nFor local installation, the source distribution file is available at Zang Lab website (\nlink\n)\n\n\nUsing SICER2\n\n\nThe terminal command to run SICER is \nsicer\n. The command to run RECOGNICER is \nrecognicer\n.\n\n\nBoth \nsicer\n command and \nrecognicer\n command take several flag-based arguments as inputs. Two arguments are required: (1) name/path of treatment file, (2) species of reference genome. Arguments for each command are explained below.\n\n\nSICER Arguments\n\n\n-t/--treatment_file (Required)\n\n\nThe file must either be in BED or BAM format (note that you need \nbedtools\n installed to directly enter BAM files).\nThe file name can either the relative path or the absolute path of the file.\n\n\n-c/--control_file (Optional)\n\n\nLike the treatment file, control file must be in BED or BAM format and can be the relative path or the absolute path of the file. However, control library input is optional.\n\n\n-s/--species (Required)\n\n\nex) \n-s hg38\n\n\n-rt/--redundancy_threshold (Optional)\n\n\nThe number of copies of indentical reads allowed in a library. Default value is 1\n\n\n-w/--window_size (Optional)\n\n\nResolution of SICER.

Default value is 0.74.\n\n\n-fdr/--false_discovery_rate (Optional)\n\n\nRemove all islands with an false-discovery-rate below cutoff. Default value is 0.01.\n\n\n-g/--gap_size (Optional)\n\n\nThe minimum length of a \"gap\" such that neighboring window is an \"island.\"\nPlease note that this value must be a multiple of the window size.\nDefault value is 600 (bp).\n\n\n-e/--e_value (Optional)\n\n\nE-value. Requires user input when no control library is provided. Default value is 1000\n\n\n-o/--output_directory (Optional)\n\n\nPath of the directory in which results will be stored. Default output directory is the current working directory.\n\n\n-cpu/--cpu (Optional)\n\n\nThe number of CPU cores SICER program will use when executing multi-processing tasks. Optimal number of cores is the species' number of chromosomes. Default value is the maximum number of cores avaiable in the system.\n\n\n--significant_reads (Optional)\n\n\nSignificant Reads: Type \"--significant_reads\" flag to have SICER produce a BED file of treatment reads filtered by significant islands and WIG file of filtered reads binned into windows.\n\n\nRECOGNICER Arguments\n\n\nAll of the arguments for RECOGNICER are identical to those of SICER except for \ngap_size\n and \ne_value\n.\nInstead of these two arguments, RECOGNICER has two arguments called \nstep_size\n and \nstep_score\n.\n\n\n-s_size/--step_size (Optional)\n\n\nThe number of windows in one graining unit. Default value is 3.\n\n\n-s_score/--step_score (Optional)\n\n\nThe minimum number of positive elements in the graining unit to call the unit positive. Default value is 2.\n\n\nUsing SICER2 for differential peak calling\n\n\nThe commands for differential peak calling are \nsicer_df\n and \nrecognicer_df\n.  \n\n\nArguments\n\n\nThe arguments for both SICER and RECOGNICER differential peak calling are identical to those of the regular peak callings except for the following arguments specified below.\n\n\nAlso, differential peak calling has one additional argument called \n----false_discovery_rate_df\n\n\n-t/--treatment_file (Required)\n\n\nTwo files must be given as input. The first file must be the knockout (KO) file and the second file must be the wild-type (WT) file.\nBoth files must either be in BED or BAM format.\n\n\n-c/--control_file (Optional)\n\n\nWhile optional, two files must be given as input if you decide to provide the input. The first file must be the control library corresponding to the knockout (KO) treatment file and the second file must be the control library corresponding to the wild-type (WT) treatment file. Both files must either be in BED or BAM format.\n\n\n-fdr_df/--false_discovery_rate_df (Optional)\n\n\nCutoff for identification of significant changes been wild-type library and knockout library. Default value is 0.01.\n\n\nExample Use\n\n\n\n\nCalling SICER with a control library.\n\nDefault parameters are explicitly entered for the sake of demonstration.\n\n\n\n\nsicer -t treatment.bed -c control.bed -s hg38 -w 200 -rt 1 -f 150 -egf 0.74 -fdr 0.01 -g 600 -e 1000\n\n\n\n\nCalling SICER without a control library\n\n\n\n\nsicer -t treatment.bed -s hg38\n\n\n\n\nCalling SICER with control libraries for differential peak calling.\n\n\n\n\nsicer_df -t treatment1.bed treatment2.bed -c control1.bed control2.bed -s hg38\n\n\n\n\nCalling SICER without control libraries for differential peak calling.\n\n\n\n\nsicer_df -t treatment1.bed treatment2.bed -s hg38",
